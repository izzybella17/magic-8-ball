Hello pals,
This program is for all my indecisive people out there who can't pick what to eat.
Basically it picks a random food place for you based on your location.

### Setting up API Keys
In order to get the app working on local machine you have to replace the value
of the API_KEY in the sample.cfg with your own Key. You'll also have to change the value
in the main.py file (default app_data.cfg).
